# Revised Evaluation Definition and Proposal for Vulnerability Detection and Fix Automation Tool

**Date**: June 2, 2025  
**Prepared by**:  
**Purpose**: To define the evaluation criteria and methodology for selecting a tool to detect vulnerabilities in merge requests (MRs), generate automated fixes, push fixes to a new branch, and create a new MR within a self-managed GitLab instance, with specific test cases for Java, Python, JavaScript, and Docker images, ensuring on-premises operation.

## 1. Objective
The evaluation aims to identify the most suitable tool among **Dependabot (via dependabot-gitlab)**, **RenovateBot**, **GitLab Dependency Scanning**, and **GitHub Copilot** to meet the following requirements:
- Detect vulnerabilities in code or dependencies within MRs for Java, Python, JavaScript, and Docker images.
- Automatically generate fixes for identified vulnerabilities.
- Push fixes to a new branch and create a new MR for review.
- Integrate seamlessly with a self-managed GitLab instance.
- Operate on-premises to comply with security policies prohibiting SaaS-based code exposure.

## 2. Requirements
### 2.1 Functional Requirements
- **FR1**: Detect vulnerabilities in code (e.g., XSS, SQL injection) or dependencies (e.g., outdated packages with CVEs) within MRs for Java, Python, JavaScript, and Docker images.
- **FR2**: Automatically generate fixes for detected vulnerabilities (e.g., dependency upgrades, code patches).
- **FR3**: Push fixes to a new branch and create a new MR.
- **FR4**: Integrate with self-managed GitLab for MR creation, CI/CD pipelines, and workflow alignment.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR1**: Operate on-premises to ensure no code or data exposure to external services.
- **NFR2**: Seamless integration with GitLab’s MR workflow, including CI/CD and reporting.
- **NFR3**: Minimize setup complexity and maintenance overhead.
- **NFR4**: Scalability to handle medium-to-large codebases (e.g., 100K LOC, 10–20 MRs/week).

### 2.3 Constraints
- **C1**: No SaaS-based solutions due to security policies.
- **C2**: Leverage existing GitLab infrastructure (e.g., self-hosted runners).
- **C3**: Cost-effective, preferably open-source or within budget.
- **C4**: Compatible with self-managed GitLab, not reliant on GitHub workflows.

## 3. Tools for Evaluation
- **Dependabot (via dependabot-gitlab)**: Open-source adaptation of GitHub’s Dependabot, automates dependency updates and vulnerability fixes via MRs in GitLab.
- **RenovateBot**: Open-source dependency management tool with GitLab support, creates MRs for dependency updates and vulnerabilities.
- **GitLab Dependency Scanning**: Built-in GitLab tool (Ultimate tier) for detecting dependency vulnerabilities, integrated into CI/CD.
- **GitHub Copilot**: AI-powered coding assistant, primarily for IDE-based code suggestions, with limited MR-level vulnerability features.

## 4. Evaluation Criteria
Tools are scored (1–5) across weighted criteria reflecting functional, non-functional, and constraint requirements. Total score is a weighted sum.

| **Criteria** | **Weight** | **Description** | **Scoring Guide** |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Vulnerability Detection (FR1) | 20% | Detect code and dependency vulnerabilities in MRs for Java, Python, JavaScript, Docker. | 5: Comprehensive code + dependency detection; 3: Dependencies only; 1: Minimal or none. |
| Automated Fixes (FR2) | 20% | Generate fixes for vulnerabilities automatically. | 5: Auto-fixes code + dependencies; 3: Dependencies only; 1: No auto-fix. |
| Branch & MR Creation (FR3) | 15% | Push fixes to a new branch and create an MR. | 5: Fully automated; 3: Partial with scripting; 1: Manual or none. |
| GitLab Integration (FR4) | 15% | Seamless integration with self-managed GitLab MRs and CI/CD. | 5: Native integration; 3: Partial via APIs; 1: No integration. |
| On-Premises Operation (NFR1) | 15% | Ensure no code exposure to external services. | 5: Fully on-premises; 3: Partial with external APIs; 1: SaaS-based. |
| Workflow Compatibility (NFR2) | 10% | Align with GitLab CI/CD and MR workflows. | 5: Seamless; 3: Moderate; 1: Poor. |
| Setup & Maintenance (NFR3) | 5% | Ease of setup and maintenance effort. | 5: Simple, low maintenance; 3: Moderate; 1: Complex, high maintenance. |

## 5. Evaluation Methodology
### 5.1 Approach
- **Criteria-Based Scoring**: Score each tool (1–5) based on documentation, community feedback, and test case performance.
- **Test Cases**: Simulate MR scenarios for Java, Python, JavaScript, and Docker images:
  - **Test Case 1 (Java)**: MR with outdated `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind` (CVE-2023-35116) in `pom.xml`. Expected: Detect vulnerability, update to secure version, create MR.
  - **Test Case 2 (Python)**: MR with vulnerable `requests==2.25.1` (CVE-2023-32681) in `requirements.txt`. Expected: Detect, update to `2.31.0`, create MR.
  - **Test Case 3 (JavaScript)**: MR with `eval` in `app.js` and outdated `lodash` (CVE-2021-23337). Expected: Detect both, patch `eval`, update `lodash`, create MR.
  - **Test Case 4 (Docker Image)**: MR with `Dockerfile` using `node:14` (CVE-2022-25881). Expected: Detect, update to `node:20`, create MR.
- **Weighting**: Functional criteria (FR1–FR4, 70%) prioritized, followed by security (NFR1, 15%) and usability (NFR2–NFR3, 15%).

### 5.2 Assumptions
- Self-managed GitLab instance (Premium or Ultimate) with CI/CD runners.
- Codebase includes Java (Maven), Python (pip), JavaScript (npm), and Docker images.
- Medium-sized codebase (100K LOC, 10–20 MRs/week).
- Infrastructure supports Docker for tool deployment.
- GitHub Copilot license available but restricted to IDE to avoid SaaS risks.
